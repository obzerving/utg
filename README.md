 Universal Tab Generator

 Attention! This program is no longer being maintained. It has been superceded by the Inkscape extension [Tabgen](https://github.com/obzerving/Tabgen).
 
Given an SVG file containing a closed path of straight lines, this program generates a paper model of tabs and score lines for each straight edge.
